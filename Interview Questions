1. What are the different types of missing data?
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random): No relationship between missing data and any other variable.

MAR (Missing at Random): Missing depends on observed data but not on the missing value itself.

MNAR (Missing Not at Random): Missingness depends on the missing value itself.

2. How do you handle categorical variables?
Use encoding techniques like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding to convert categories into numbers.

3. What is the difference between normalization and standardization?
Normalization scales data to a range (usually 0 to 1).

Standardization transforms data to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.

4. How do you detect outliers?
Visual methods: Boxplots, Scatter plots.

Statistical methods: IQR (Interquartile Range), Z-score method.

5. Why is preprocessing important in ML?
It improves data quality, handles inconsistencies, prepares data for algorithms, and boosts model accuracy.

6. What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?
Label Encoding: Assigns a unique number to each category (e.g., Male=0, Female=1).

One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category (e.g., Male: [1,0], Female: [0,1]).

7. How do you handle data imbalance?
Oversampling minority class (e.g., SMOTE).

Undersampling majority class.

Use different metrics like F1-score instead of just accuracy.

8. Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?
Yes!
Good preprocessing (like handling missing values, scaling, encoding properly) makes models learn better patterns and prevents bias or wrong predictions.
